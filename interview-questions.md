# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is the scripting language used in React. It combines elements of HTML and JavaScript. A syntax difference between HTML and JSX is that JSX can use fragments whereas HTML can only use divs.

Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript and allows developers to incorporate HTML into React.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager. It controls and utilizes files and dependencies to analyze and manipulate a developer's code as directed. Running yarn in the command terminal adds its files and dependencies to the working folder.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for a developer's code. It allows developers to use and share their code with others. Running yarn in the terminal adds the package.json and yarn.lock dependencies.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values reference input into the application from the web page whereas props reference properties of the application itself from the app.js. For example, a visitor to a web page could enter their age which would be updating the state value of the application. A component in the application could use a prop to refer to a property on the app.js that lists an age range.

Researched answer: State values manage data within the main component and props send data from the main component to subordinate components. The setState function can update state values but props are set and do not change.

4. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Researched answer: A div tag separates blocks of code for organization and styling. A span tag highlights only a few words or a sentence for styling.
